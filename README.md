GTimeUtils
=========

**A simple stopwatch and timer, written in GTK.**

Usage
-----

A small word about the usage of, for now, Gtimer. Gtimer can take four (five if you count the help message) command line arguments:

	-s, --seconds     Specify seconds to count down from
	-m, --minutes     Specify minutes to count down from
	-u, --hours       Specify hours to count down from
	-t, --text        Set an alternative notification text
	-r, --run         Immediately start the countdown

Installation
------------

GTimeUtils supports both GTK 2.x and GTK 3.x. You can choose which version to built at compile time. By default GTK 3.x will be used.
You'll need your chosen GTK version's headers with the libnotify and libcanberra headers installed and ready to go. To
build, simply run these commands:

	$ make -GTK3
	  or
	$ make -GTK2
	# make clean install

ToDo
----

* Gtimer: minimize to tray.
