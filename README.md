GTimeUtils
=========

**A simple stopwatch and timer, written in GTK3.**

Usage
-----

A small word about the usage of, for now, Gtimer. Gtimer can take four (five if you count the help message) command line arguments:

	-s, --seconds     Specify seconds to count down from
	-m, --minutes     Specify minutes to count down from
	-u, --hours       Specify hours to count down from
	-t, --text        Set an alternative notification text
	-r, --run         Immediately start the countdown

Installation
------------

You'll need the GTK 3.x, libnotify and libcanberra libraries and headers installed and ready to go. To
build, simply run these commands:

	$ make
	# make clean install
